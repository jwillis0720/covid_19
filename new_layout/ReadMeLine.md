##### What am I looking at? 
This app enhances visualization of objects detected using state-of-the-art Mobile Vision Neural Networks.
Most user generated videos are dynamic and fast-paced, which might be hard to interpret. A confidence
heatmap stays consistent through the video and intuitively displays the model predictions. The pie chart
lets you interpret how the object classes are divided, which is useful when analyzing videos with numerous
and differing objects.

##### More about this Dash app

The purpose of this demo is to explore alternative visualization methods for object detection. Therefore,
the visualizations, predictions and videos are not generated in real time, but done beforehand. To read
more about it, please visit the [project repo](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/master/apps/dash-object-detection).
